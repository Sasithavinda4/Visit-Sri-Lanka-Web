                            the
                            central Matale District of Sri Lanka. It is a massive rock fortress that rises over 200

                            The fortress was built in the 5th century by King Kasyapa, who sought to create a royal
                            residence that would be both secure and luxurious. He transformed the top of the rock
                            into a
                            palace complex, complete with gardens, swimming pools, and a series of terraced
                            platforms.
